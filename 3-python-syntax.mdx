# Python Syntax

Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```
\

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

```python
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```
\

## Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code

```python
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

```
\

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.

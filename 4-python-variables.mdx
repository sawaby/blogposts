# Python Variables

In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Let's explore the basics of Python variables.

## Variable Assignment

To assign a value to a variable, use the equal (`=`) sign:

```python
# Example of variable assignment
x = 10
name = "John"
is_python_fun = True
```
\

Here, x is assigned the integer value 10, name is assigned the string value "John", and is_python_fun is assigned the boolean value True.

## Variable Naming Rules

When naming variables in Python, adhere to the following rules:

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
The rest of the variable name can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different variables).

```python
# Valid variable names
user_age = 25
_last_updated = "2023-01-01"

```

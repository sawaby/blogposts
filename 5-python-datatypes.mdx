# Data Types
Python supports various data types, and the type of a variable is determined dynamically:

```python
# Integer
count = 42

# Float
pi = 3.14

# String
greeting = "Hello, Python!"

# Boolean
is_valid = True

```
\

## Variable Reassignment
You can change the value of a variable by reassigning it:

```python
# Variable reassignment
x = 5
print(x)  # Outputs: 5

x = x + 3
print(x)  # Outputs: 8

```
\


## Multiple Assignment

Python allows you to assign multiple variables in a single line:

```python
# Multiple assignment
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```

Here, a is assigned 1, b is assigned 2, and c is assigned 3.

## conclution

Understanding how to work with variables is fundamental to Python programming. As you write more code, you'll find that variables play a crucial role in storing, manipulating, and representing data in your programs.

# Getting Started

To start coding in Python, you need to have it installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

Once installed, you can create and run your first Python script. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the above code in a file with a .py extension, for example, hello.py, and run it from the command line:

```
python hello.py
```

Congratulations! You've just executed your first Python script.

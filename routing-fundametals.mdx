- **Tree**: A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.
- **Subtree**: Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).
- **Root**: The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.
- **Leaf**: Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.
